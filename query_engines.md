# Overview

Roughly two models:
* pull based model (volcano model)
* push based model

The volcano model is the predominant one. It works on the assumption that the driving force is the top level consumer which forces each of the underlying iterators to move forward. This proceeds recursively.

```
      +------------+
      |  Consumer  |
      +------------+
            ^
            |
      +------------+
      |  Filter    |
      +------------+
            ^
            |
      +------------+
      |   Scan     |
      +------------+
```

The push based model seems a more recent one. Here the driving force starts from the "bottom", with each node forcing its parents to take ownership of a result set.

```
      +------------+
      |  Consumer  |
      +------------+
            |
            v
      +------------+
      |  Filter    |
      +------------+
            |
            v
      +------------+
      |   Scan     |
      +------------+
```

### Notes From Volcano Paper
This image is a great overview of how Volcano works as an execution engine and fits into the pipeline with an optimizer, buffer pool etc.
